## Materials and Methods

### Environment

A general tool for creating RL tasks was design (_Forest Fire Environment Maker (FFEM)_). The tool generates environments based on the forest fire CA, specifically the Drossel and Schwabl model (DSM) [@drossel1992self]. We developed the tool from an initial idea of an "helicopter" flying over the symbolic wild fire, represented by the DMS, trying to extinguish the fire by means of allowing the "helicopter" to change fire cells to empty cells. During the implementation the environment was naturally generalized. The basic idea is to have an agent on top of the CA lattice. The agent has its own state and parameters. Particularly it has an specified position at one of the nodes of the CA, where it can act by changing the cell on that position to another of its cell states. The agent navigates the CA changing cells states. When the agent reads its next instruction it moves to a new cell (or stays in place) and then affects, if applicable, the destination. After some agent movements the CA is updated and the full process is repeated.

The ability of allowing an agent to change the CA configurations express the attempt to drive the CA to a desired global state. In the RL framework this is done by giving a reward to the agent at each emitted action. This was done by mere counting all cell states indicating unwanted behavior and then multiplying by some weight (usually negative). This was generalized into getting the frequency of any cell type and then multiplying by a weight to generate a score per cell type. Then all the scores were combined into a global score. In summary the used reward function was the dot product of the cell-states frequencies by some weights, with the semantics that weights for desirable states are greater than the unwanted ones.

The particular environment that was used for this thesis is one that has the semantics of a "helicopter" trying to extinguish a forest fire. This is represented by an agent influencing the dynamics of a DSM and is as follows: The first component is a DSM with a lattice of size 3x3 with parameters $p=0.33$ (tree growth probability) and $f=0.066$ (tree spontaneous burning probability). The used boundary conditions were set to invariant using an extra exogenous cell type that it is not involved in any CA dynamics, we just called them "rocks". The starting lattice configuration was made via random sampling by cell with probability of choosing "tree" of $0.75$ and "fire" of $0.25$. The second component, the agent ("helicopter") has a starting position in the middle of the lattice (_2nd row and column_), from there it can move in any direction of a Moore's neighborhood, thus the agent can choose from $9$ actions (_"Left-Up", "Up", "Right-Up", "Right", "Stay", "Left", "Left-Down", "Down", "Right-Down"_), then after arriving to its new destination the helicopter extinguishes the fire, represented by changing, if applicable, a "fire" cell to "empty". After some movements of the "helicopter" the forest fire CA is updated following the dynamics dictated by DSM. The specific sequence of agent movements and CA updates is: _move, update, move, move, update, move, move, update, move, move, ..._ (see \@ref(fig:thesis-3-3-env)). In accordance to the RL paradigm, at each performed action the environment must respond with a reward signal, in our setting this was $+1$ per "tree" cell and $-1$ per "fire" cell, in other words a balance between trees and fires. Finally the RL task was continuous.

We selected the parameters of the DMS by seeking a separation between the scales of $f$ and $p$ ($f \ll p$), since a steady state is reached when $\lim \frac {f}{p} \to 0$ [@drossel1992self] and we wanted to see if the agent would significatively alter the dynamics of the CA. In our case $\frac {f}{p}=$ `r 0.066/0.33`. Alongside, empirical tunning was conducted from running the environment with a random policy to select the exact values of $f$ and $p$ that would make the grid relatively active at each step. It is important to note that the steady state only appears on large grids, as smaller ones are subject to finite size effects [@drossel1992self], thus we paid more attention to the empirical second criterion. Nevertheless balancing the two parameters would be important in future grid scaling experiments.

Moreover the FFEM tool adds two new cells types. A "rock" type that does not interact with anything and is used as a barrier to the fire dynamics, it is always constant. A "lake" type that behaves exactly like a "rock" but it marks special positions in the grid that can alter the "helicopter" internal state. For example an idea (yet to be implemented) is to make the "power" of the "helicopter" limited so it would need to use it "wisely" and then would go to a "lake" to recharge it, akin to refilling its tank to keep fighting the wild fire. Also the FFEM tool generalizes the "powers" of the "helicopter" allowing for the exchange of any cell type for another, this lets for the creation of environments with a diversity of semantics like: An environment where the agent has to put barriers or one where it has to strategically deforest to prevent the spread of fire or even one where it has to completly reorganize the CA lattice. Even more functionality was included like a deterministic mode, generalized reward functions and several termination conditions, to check all the FFEM features consult: *https://github.com/elbecerrasoto/gym-forest-fire*.

(ref:thesis-3-3-env) Illustration of two transitions in the proposed environment. On time $t$ the helicopter is at 2nd row and column, then it moves to the left, on arriving to its new position it changes the "fire" cell to "empty". Then, at the next time step, it returns to its original position, however the CA was updated before its arrival, anyway the "fire" cell at the middle (not shown) is promptly eliminated and replaced by an "empty" cell. The parameter $m$ is an internal state of the environment, that is decreased by $1$ at each step, when it reaches $0$ the CA is updated at the next step, before the action takes place, and then $m$ is restored to it max value ($m=1$). The current reward $r$ is $+1$ per "tree" and $-1$ per "fire".

### Deep Q Networks

We tried to solve the proposed environment using model-free, value-function approximation RL. This approach is justified by the lack of general analytical models for CA dynamics [@ilachinski2001cellular] and their combinatorial explosion of states. For illustration in our small 3x3 environment the combinatorics are $3^9$ grid states multiplied by $3^2$ "helicopter" positions and $2$ internal states for the agent-environment synchronization, giving a grand total of $2 \times 3^2 \times 3^9 =$ `r 2 * 3^2 * 3^9`, a still manageable quantity by tabular RL standards, however merely scaling to a 16x16 grid leads to an untenable $\approx 10^{124}$ states.

Deep Q Networks (DQN) [@mnih2013playing][@mnih2015human] meets the previously stated conditions and is well suited for tasks with a discrete set of actions and when sampling from the environment is low-cost. We implemented DQN with $n$-step unrolling of the Bellman optimality equation for $Q$ values [@sutton1988learning]. The implementation was made in Python 3.x, the _lingua franca_ of AI and RL. The non-linear $Q$ function approximator was an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). We implemented the _experience replay_ memory as a _double-ended queue_ (deque) data structure, which behaves as a list but allows for efficient "appends" and "pops" from either side ($\mathcal{O}(1)$). (see *https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/collections.html?highlight=collections#collections.deque*). Thus for a fixed size of an _experience replay_, incoming observations are appended to one end and old observations are "popped" from the other.

A high level explanation of our DQN implementation [(see Apendix 1)](#deep-q-networks-dqn-using-open-ai-gym-api) is as follows: The logic of the $e$-greedy policy was abstracted into an "Agent class" which also holds a memory of past observations (_experience replay_), during the training loop the agent performs an action and advances the environment one step, saving the transition tuple $(s,a,r,s')$ into its own memory. Then the agent samples a minibatch of transitions from the memory buffer and feeds it to the ANN model. A forward prediction of $Q$ values for all $9$ actions is computed followed by a backward optimization step. These sequence of agent acts and ANN train steps is iterated during $T$ steps. Each $C$ training steps the weights of the policy and target networks are syncronized.

### Preprocessing

The FFEM tool generates environments that follow the guidelines of the _Open AI Gym API_ (OAGA) [@1606.01540]. The API specifies that the observation should be a numerical vector, that is commonly returned as a _numpy_ $n$-dimensional array [@walt2011numpy]. In our implementation we instead returned a tuple of three _numpy arrays_ representing: the grid data (cell states), the position of the helicopter and the remaining moves ($m$) to CA updating. We made the knowledge of $m$ available to the agent to guarantee the Markov property. A more difficult RL task can be made by not knowing $m$ (just dropping its value from the tuple), thus shifting the system to a _Partially Observable Markov Decision Process_ (POMDP), where the hidden state $m$ should be infered by the agent. Strictly speaking our implementation is departing from the _Open AI Gym API_ observation specification, however it does it in favor of facilitating the data processing and if purity is insisted on, merely concatenating the data and reshaping it into a single _numpy array_ would fix it.

The input to the ANN models was a one-hot encoding of the CA grid concatenated with the "helicopter" position and the $m$ remaining moves parameter. This was supported by a FFEM feature to indicate the output format of the CA lattice, that can be returned in plain numeric representation, one-hot encoding or by channels as the CA lattice can be interpreted as an image.

### ANN Architectures

Model-free, value-function approximation RL tries to tackle the intractability of directly estimating $Q(s,a)$ for a high number of state-action pairs with a parametrized version $Q(s,a;\theta)$. In the case of Deep Reinforcement Learning $Q$ is approximated by a ANN with parameters $\theta$.

A naive, nonetheless intuitive, approch is to directly translate $Q(s,a): S \times A \to \mathds{R}$ to a network architecture that predicts a $Q$-value for each state-action pair. However this approach incurs on $|A|$ forward computions of the ANN since in order to get the next action following the _greedy policy_, we need to check for all values of the available actions $\forall a \in A(S_t): Q(s,a;\theta)$. One of the key insights of the DQN algorithm [@mnih2013playing][@mnih2015human] was to change to an architecture of the form $Q_{network}: S \to \mathds{R}^{|A|}$, predicting all $Q$-values in a single forward pass and also with the extra justification that perhaps the model would learn features about state $s$ that can be reused to predict all $Q$-values for a given $s$. This architecture is know as the $Q_{network}$.

Three different $Q_{network}$ architectures were used. The models were build using the _Pytorch_ library [@NEURIPS2019_9015]. They were Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) with four or three hidden layers and ReLU activations. The weights and biases were initialized under the _Pytorch_ defaults (_Kaiming uniform_ [@he2015delving]). The tensors transformations of the layers are described below:

+ Architecture 1 (A1):
$$(30 \times 1) \to (128 \times 1) \to (256 \times 1) \to (128 \times 1) \to (32 \times 1) \to (9 \times 1)$$
+ Architecture 2 (A2):
$$(30 \times 1) \to (256 \times 1) \to (128 \times 1) \to (64 \times 1) \to (9 \times 1)$$
+ Architecture 3 (A3):
$$(30 \times 1) \to (256 \times 1) \to (512 \times 1) \to (256 \times 1) \to (64 \times 1) \to (9 \times 1)$$

### Training Details

A $Q_{network}$ capable of predicting the values of the actions would solve the Reinforcement Learning problem (the agent would act greedily over the $Q$-values). Unluckily training a $Q_{network}$ could be tricky as theoretical convergence results are only available for linear approximators [@tsitsiklis1997analysis]. Aditionally _Supervised Learning_ techniques assume that the data was generated from the same distribution and its instances are _i.i.d_, both assumptions are violated because the training distribution is constantly changing as the implicit policy defined by the network is changing and the generated observations are highly correlated. To combat the inestability that arises DQN uses a replay memory and a target network.

Nine experiments were run using the described environment, between experiments some hyperparametes were allowed to vary, namely the type of initial exploration, the unrolling of the Bellman's update, the network architecture, learning rate, batch size, and $\gamma$ disscount parameter.

Each experiment was run on _[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com)_ cloud service using their provided GPUs and computing resources. Their run for 1,200,000 epochs each, divided in 400,000 exploration and 800,000 of exploting epochs. Two exploration schemes were used, for some models a linear annealing  of $\epsilon$ from $1.0$ to $0.10$ and for others a simple heruristic that moves the helicopter to any fire cell on the neighborhood, choosing randomly when more than one fire cell was present.

The employed optimization algorithm was Adam [@kingma2014adam] with default _[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html)_ values, with the exeption of _learning rate_ that was set manually per experiment (see ). Each transition tuple in the _experience replay_ only estimates a single $Q(s,a)$ value, however the output of the $Q_{network}$ is a vector of $Q$ values for all actions so during optimization steps only the weights involved in the calculation of a single $Q(s,a)$ value must be updated.
