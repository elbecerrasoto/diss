## Cellular Automata

Cellular Automata are mathematical systems that are mainly characterized by [@ilachinski2001cellular]:

1. A discrete lattice of cells:
A n-dimesional arragement of cells, usually 1-D, 2-D or 3-D.

2. Homogenity:
Cells are equivalent in the sense that they share an update function and a set of possible states.

3. Discrete states:
Each cell is in one state from a finite set of possible states.

4. Local Interactions:
Cell interactions are local, this is given by the update function being dependant on neighbouring cells.

5. Discrete Dynamics:
The system evolves in discrete time steps. At each step the update function is applied simultaneously (synchronously) to all cells.

Despite this apparent simplicity CA are capable of complex behaviour. Their dynamics only defined in terms of local rules exhibit non-trivial patterns at considerable larger scales. The structures that emerge where not designed a priori and their nature is capricious as they could be oscillating, chaotic, ordered, random, transient, stable. This complex behaviour is rich enough to be used to model natural systems.

## CA and Computation

## Mathematical Definition

The following is adapted from the book Probabilistic Cellular Automata [@louis2018probabilistic].

Cellullar Automata (CA) are dynanimal systems of interconnected finite-state automata (cells). The automata evolution is thorugh discrete time steps and it is dictated by a function dependant on a neighborhood of interacting automata.

The main mathematical aspects of a CA are:

* The network $G$:
A graph $G$.
$$ G = (V(G), E(G)) $$
The set of vertices $V(G)$ represents the location of the automata (cells). The set of edges $E(G)$ describes the spatial relations between automata.

* The alphabet $S$:
Defines the states that each automata can take. In common CA settings $S$ is a finite set. It is also called _local space_ or _spin space_.

* The configuration space $S^{V(G)}$:
This is the set of all posible states of the CA. A specific configuration is denoted as:
$$ \sigma = \{\sigma_k \in V(G)\} $$
$\sigma_k f$ is the configuration of the automaton at position $k$.

* The neighborhoods $V_k$:
$$ V_k \subset  V(G) $$
The subset of nodes that can influence or interact with the automaton at $k \in V(G)$ (ordinarily it includes itself). A typical configuration for $V_k$ is: $G = \mathds{Z}^2$, and $V_k = \{k, k\pme_1, k\pme_2}$, where $(e_1, e_2)$ is the canonical basis of $\mathds{Z}^2$, (north/south, east/west). This is known as the _von Neumman neighborhood_.

* The global update $F$:
$$ F: S^{V(G)} \rightarrow S^{V(G)} $$
$$ (F(\sigma))_k = f_k(\sigma_V_k) $$
The global update $F$ is calculated by applying a local function $f_k$ per automata at $k$. In the classical setting $f_k$ is the same for all the automata.

## Probabilistic Cellular Automata

Generalizations to the classical attributes of CA can be made allowing for extensions like [@ilachinski2001cellular]:

* Asynchronous CA:

* Coupled-map Lattices:

* Probabilistic CA:

* Non-homogenenous CA:

* Mobile CA:

* Structurally Dynamics CA:

## History

Earlier precusor ideas about Cellular Automata (CA) can be traced back to 1946 cybernetics models of exitable media of Wiener and Rosenbluth [@weiner1946mathematical], however their usual agreed inception was when in 1948 Jonh von Neumann following a suggestion from mathematician Stanislaw Ulam introduced CA to study self replicating systems, particularly biological ones [@von1951general][@von1966theory].

Von Neumann's basic idea was to build a lattice in $\mathds{Z}^2$ capable of copying itself, to another location in $\mathds{Z}^2$. The solution, in spite of being elaborate and involving 29 different cell states, was modular and intuitive. Since then more constructions capable of the same feat have been found with a lesser number of states [@codd1968cellular]. 

In the 1960's theoretical studies of CA were made, especially as intances of dynamical systems and their relation to the field of symbolic dynamics. A notable result from the epoch is the Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon theorem [@hedlund1969endomorphisms], which characterizes translation-invariant CA transformations. 

In 1969 Konrad Zuse publisehd the book _Calculating Space_  [@zuse1970calculating] with the thesis that the universe is fundametally discrete and the product of the computations of a CA-like machinery.

Likewise in 1969 

A key moment came with the invention of 2-D CA Game of Life. Pure mathematician J.H. Conway created "Life" as a solitaire and simulation type game. To play "Life" a checkboard was needed, then counters or chips were put on top of some squares. This represented an initial alive population of organisms and the initial configuration would evolve following reproduction and dying rules. The rules were tweaked by Conway to produce unpredictable and mesmerazing patterns. The game was made popular when was published as recreational mathematics by Martin Gardner in 1970 [@gardner1970mathematical]. Despite its name and interesting properties "Life" has little biological meaning and should be only interpreted as a methapor [@ermentrout1993cellular].

During the 80s the notoriety of CA was boosted to the current status as CA became quintessential examples of complex systems. The focus of research was shifted towards  CA as modeling tools. Is in this decade that the first CA conference was held at MIT [@ilachinski2001cellular] and that a seminal review article of Stephen Wolfram was published [@wolfram1983statistical].

Since then applications have been coming in a variety of domains. In the biological sciences models of exitable media, developmental biology, ecology, shell pattern formation and immunology, to name a few, have been proposed [@ermentrout1993cellular]. CA can be applied in image processing for noise removal and border detection [@popovici2002cellular]. For physical systems fluid and gas dynamics are well suited for CA modeling [@margolus1984physics]. Also they have been proposed as a discrete approach to expresing physical laws [@vichniac1984simulating].
