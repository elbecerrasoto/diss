# Cellular Automata

## Introduction

Cellular Automata (sg. Cellular Automaton) are computational and mathematical systems with two essential characteristics: a discrete structure and local interaction between its parts, but its killer feature is that they are simple.

A quick _Google Scholar_ search for the term "Cellular Automata", retrieves roughly 13,000 research articles since the last year (2019). Despite not being as popular (by the same metric) as other topics, like "Cancer" (~128,000) or "Deep Learning" (~104,000), they are, arguably, still popular.

The topic of CA dates back to the 1950's spanning a history of 70 years. Since then the mathematical and practical properties of CA have been studied and its applications have been explored in different branches of science including physical and social.

Perhaps the reason behind this popularity is their simplicity. CA are composed of decentralized interactions of their individual parts (cells), these cells are usually  arranged in a very regular grid and are updated following the same rules for all cells. The rules only take into account the vicinity of a given cell. From this design specifications one could naively anticipate that a very homogeneous state is reached after some iterations of the CA. But this is not always the case, surprisingly for some simple configurations and rules, complex behavior emerges. This behavior is rich enough to be used to model natural systems. The structures that arises from local interactions where not designed _a priori_ and their nature is capricious as they could be oscillating, chaotic, ordered, random, transient, stable. Their scale is also far from the initial size of the cell neighborhoods.

## Main Characteristics

Cellular Automata are mathematical objects that are mainly characterized by [@ilachinski2001cellular]:

1. A discrete lattice of cells:
A n-dimensional arrangement of cells, usually 1-D, 2-D or 3-D.

2. Homogeneity:
Cells are equivalent in the sense that they share an update function and a set of possible states.

3. Discrete states:
Each cell is in one state from a finite set of possible states.

4. Local Interactions:
Cell interactions are local, this is given by the update function being dependent on neighboring cells.

5. Discrete Dynamics:
The system evolves in discrete time steps. At each step the update function is applied simultaneously (synchronously) to all cells.

## Mathematical Definition

The following is adapted from the book Probabilistic Cellular Automata [@louis2018probabilistic].

Cellular Automata (CA) are dynamical systems of interconnected finite-state automata (cells). The automata evolution is through discrete time steps and it is dictated by a function dependent on a neighborhood of interacting automata.

The main mathematical aspects of a CA are:

* The network $G$:
A graph $G$.
$$ G = (V(G), E(G)) $$
The set of vertices $V(G)$ represents the location of the automata (cells). The set of edges $E(G)$ describes the spatial relations between automata.

* The alphabet $S$:
Defines the states that each automata can take. In common CA settings $S$ is a finite set. It is also called _local space_ or _spin space_.

* The configuration space $S^{V(G)}$:
This is the set of all possible states of the CA. A specific configuration is denoted as:
$$ \sigma = \{\sigma_k \in V(G)\} $$
$\sigma_k$ is the configuration of the automaton at position $k$.

* The neighborhoods $V_k$:
$$ V_k \subset  V(G) $$
The subset of nodes that can influence or interact with the automaton at $k \in V(G)$ (ordinarily it includes itself). A typical configuration for $V_k$ is: $G = \mathds{Z}^2$, and $V_k = \{k, k \pm e_1, k \pm e_2\}$, where $(e_1, e_2)$ is the canonical basis of $\mathds{Z}^2$, (north/south, east/west). This is known as the _von Neumman neighborhood_.

* The global update $F$:
$$ F: S^{V(G)} \rightarrow S^{V(G)} $$
$$ (F(\sigma))_k = f_k(\sigma_{V_k}) $$
The global update $F$ is calculated by applying a local function $f_k$ per automata at $k$. In the classical setting $f_k$ is the same for all the automata.

## Classification

Wolfram from extensive simulations of 1-D CA grouped the general behavior of CA in four informally defined classes [@wolfram2002new]. The classification is done by simulation from a variety of lattice initializations to broadly characterize the CA.

1. Class 1: A quick evolution towards a homogeneous global state is observed. All cells stop changing and all the randomness in the initial configuration disappears.

2. Class 2: The CA evolution leads to isolated patterns that could be periodic or stable.

3. Class 3: Pseudo-random or chaotic patterns emerge. Any stable structure is quickly destroyed by the surrounding noise.

4. Class 4: This is the most interesting type of behavior. Patterns that interact in a complex way emerge. These complex patterns are stable for long periods of time. Eventually the complex patterns can settle into a global state like Class 2 behavior but this can take a vast amount of time. Wolfram has conjectured that many Class 4 
CA are capable of universal computation [@wolfram2002new].

This classification was inspired by the behavior observed in continuum dynamical systems. For example the homogeneous states of class 1 CA are analogous to fixed-point attracting states, or the repeating structures of class 2 CA are analogous to continuous limit cycles and class 3 chaotic patterns are analogous to strange attractors, while class 4 behavior does not have an obvious continuum analogy [@ilachinski2001cellular].

Other classification schemes can be found in the literature like: based in the structure of their attractors [@kuurka1997languages] or by the structure of their "Garden of Eden" states (non-reachable global states) [@kari1994reversibility].

## Modeling of Complex Systems

Since the consolidation of the scientific method in the XVII century two methodologies emerged for generating and evaluating scientific knowledge. Them being the "experimental" and the "theoretical" paradigms. The experimental paradigm is concerned with observing, measuring and quantifying natural phenomena in order to test an hypothesis. Experimentation also can be made in a playful manner to collect and organize data. The theoretical paradigm seeks logical and mathematical explanations of natural phenomena. Both paradigms are complementary in the sense that predictions can be made by the theoretical paradigm and be tested using the experimental one, then if the experimental findings support the predictions the theory is kept otherwise is rejected. In other words theory can be supported or falsified through experimentation.

A third scientific paradigm recently appeared, namely the "computational" paradigm. In this approach the study of nature is done through computer simulations. The computational paradigm works in partnership with the "experimental" and "theoretical" ones, so where observed phenomena are not easily tractable by analytical descriptions or direct experimentation is not allowed, computational simulation still permits further inquiry. Still when possible the outputs from the computations can be validated against experimental data and predictions from the theory, thus establishing helpful feedback between paradigms. The invention of the digital computer enabled the numerical solution of analytical models by means of discretization of quantities. Finally the computational paradigm can sometimes be used as a shortcut to the theoretical or experimental paradigms, for example if the problem at hand is well characterized, data obtained from a simulation could be employed as a proxy for real world data or by the contrary if the studied phenomena is poorly understood a first computational approach could be performed. 

The theoretical and computational paradigms force us to formally disclose our assumptions in the form of variables, processes and relationships among them, thus forming what is known as an abstract model or simply a model. Mathematical and computational models can be grouped according on how _state_, _space_ and _time_ variables are abstracted into the model [@hoekstra2010simulating].

Complex systems is a broadly defined term to encompass dynamical systems with more than a few interacting parts commonly in a non-linear way, in simple terms systems that have emergent properties from individual interactions. This kind of systems are common in the the natural and social sciences. One of the classical examples is the formation of ant colonies and the organization that comes with it [@holldobler1994journey]. Each ant is sensing external stimuli and acting upon them, the cumulative reactions of all the ants culminates in the building of the ant-hill, feeding it, defending it and attacking other ant colonies. Everything from following from 20 to 40 responses to a particular stimuli.

As seen by the ant-colony example, a correctly chosen set of interacting rules for a group of identical generic entities can create self-organization and/or emergent behavior [@bak2013nature]. However a general algorithm to find a correct set of local rules to produce a target global behavior is not know [@hoekstra2010simulating]. Regardless going in the opposite way is as easy as running a simulation using a proposed set of rules and checking if the yield the target behavior.
In summary the question, What set of rules yields this behavior? Is extremely difficult, yet asking, Does this set of particular rules yields this behavior? Is rather easy.

In CA the same dichotomy arises. Going from local rules to global behavior (local to global mapping) is as easy as to just perform the computations defined by the CA but going  in the other direction (global mapping to local) is extremely difficult. This issue is known as the "inverse problem". Regardless of its difficulty numerous attempts have been tried, with limited success. A common approach is the usage of optimization techniques like evolutionary algorithms or simulated annealing to find rules driving the system to desired attractor basins [@ganguly2003survey].

The semantics of CA made them readily available to model complex systems. In fact Ilachinski mentions that _"CA are, fundamentally the simplest mathematical representations of a much broader class of complex systems."_ [@ilachinski2001cellular]. The modeling of a complex system using CA often proceeds in a bottom-up manner. Initially essential properties of the interacting parts are abstracted and then codified into the updating rules of CA cells. Secondly the simulation is run in order to learn the _mesoscopic laws_ that emerge from the individual interactions. With domain knowledge this process could be iterated, first proposing essential rules and see if they produce reasonable emergent behavior and then improving the rules from this feedback. Finally the system could be enlarged to a gigantic simulation (mainly in space) to get the _macroscopic_ final behavior.

However Toffoli points out that this is not the best allocation of computational budget and recommends to use the learned _mesoscopic laws_ as input for higher-level analytical or numerical models [@hoekstra2010simulating]. To give an example he imagines a CA that predicts the formation of water droplets from simple interactions of particles. Then if the computational resources are available the model could be escalated millions and millions of times to model fog, clouds, all the way up to global weather. However scaling in this way is not really necessary as once the bulk properties of a water droplet have been found they could easily be feed as numerical parameters of a higher-level model (e.g. differential equation), so in the end the CA had help us to get something like droplets per cubic meters or temperature an so forth. In Toffoli words _"A successful CA model is the seed of its own demise!"_, nonetheless at the end of the day the CA had help us taming the complex system and clearly expressing the essential microscopic dynamics of the system.

## Computing

An analogy between CA and conventional computers can be made. The initial configuration of a CA could be though as input data to be computed over by the CA rules, producing results several time steps ahead and displayed on whatever configuration reached by the lattice.

This analogy is not coincidence at all and it is further exposed by the history of CA. In the early 1950's von Neumann was trying to build a machine that not only should be self-replicating but also capable of universal computability. Von Neumann's endeavors were successful and produced the first two-dimensional automaton formally shown to be Turing-complete [@von1966theory]. Twenty years later John Conway's "Game of Life" was introduced and later was also found to be computationally universal [@elwin1982winning][@poundstone2013recursive]. More recently 1-D CA "Rule 110" has been proved to be universal and is one of the simplest known systems with such property [@cook2004universality].

The usual strategy to prove that a given CA is universal is to show its equivalence with other systems known to be universal. Other strategy is to directly build on the lattice all the primitive elements of computing, namely _storage_ (memory), _transmission_ (internal clock and wires) and _processing_ (AND, OR and NOT gates) [@ilachinski2001cellular]. Once a given system supports these computational primitives building an universal machine becomes a clerical work of assembling modules. The "Game of Life" is proven to be universal in this fashion.

On the other hand possessing the same power as a conventional digital computer plays an important role on our mathematical ability to make predictions on the behavior of CA, because all universal computers require resources in the same order of magnitude to process a particular algorithm, thus in general a computational shortcut to the simulation of any universal CA does not exist [@toffoli1977cellular]. This implies that even if an analytical expression for exactly capturing the evolution of a universal CA is obtained, evaluating such expression would take asymptotically the same time as just running the CA and observing its own evolution. Thus remarkably the most efficient way to characterize a universal CA is through its own simulation [@ilachinski2001cellular]. 

Furthermore locality being one of the main ingredients of CA imposes an almost independent update on each cell that is only influenced by its neighbors. As the execution of the program by the CA is being carried out individually by its cells the computations are being executed in a fully parallel manner. Consequently simulations on CA allow for efficient parallel implementations of any real world system that can be codified into the CA formalism. For example CA based machines CAMs (CA Machines) have been proposed by Toffoli and others [@toffoli1984cam]. A hardware implementation of a CAM was developed at MIT [@margolus1995cam] that for the modeling of complex systems it could achieve a performance of several orders of magnitude higher that a traditional computer at a comparable cost.

### Generalized Cellular Automata

Generalizations to the classical attributes of CA can be conceived [@ilachinski2001cellular] enabling extensions like:

* Asynchronous CA:
Allows asynchronous updating of the CA.

* Coupled-map Lattices:
Allows real valued cell states. These systems are simpler than partial differential equations but more complex that standard CA.

* Probabilistic CA:
The rules are allowed to be stochastic, assigning probabilities to cell state transitions.

* Non-homogeneous CA:
Updating functions are allowed to vary from cell to cell. A simple example is a CA with two rules distributed randomly throughout the lattice. On the other extreme case, simulations have been performed with random assignment of all Boolean functions with small number of inputs [@kauffman1984emergent].

* Boolean Networks:
A type of non-homogeneous CA with variable inputs per node [@alonso2011discrete].

* Mobile CA:
In this model some cells can move through the lattice. The mobile parts of the CA can be thought as robots or agents and their movement is dictated from an internal state that reflects the features of the local environment.

* Structurally Dynamic CA:
Considers the possibility of evolving cell arrangement. In standard CA the lattice is only a substrate for the ongoing computation, but what happens when this passivity is removed.

## History

Precursor ideas about Cellular Automata (CA) can be traced back to 1946 cybernetics models of excitable media of Wiener and Rosenbluth [@weiner1946mathematical], however their usual agreed upon inception was when in 1948 John von Neumann following a suggestion from mathematician Stanislaw Ulam introduced CA to study self replicating systems, particularly biological ones [@von1951general][@von1966theory].

Von Neumann's basic idea was to build a lattice in $\mathds{Z}^2$ capable of copying itself, to another location in $\mathds{Z}^2$. The solution, in spite of being elaborate and involving 29 different cell states, was modular and intuitive. Since then more constructions capable of the same feat have been found with a lesser number of states [@codd1968cellular]. 

In the 1960's theoretical studies of CA were made, especially as instances of dynamical systems and their relation to the field of symbolic dynamics. A notable result from the epoch is the Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon theorem [@hedlund1969endomorphisms], which characterizes translation-invariant CA transformations. 

In 1969 Konrad Zuse published the book _Calculating Space_  [@zuse1970calculating] with the thesis that the universe is fundamentally discrete as a result of the computations of a CA-like machinery. Likewise during 1960's computer scientist Alvy Ray Smith demonstrated that 1-D CA are capable of universal computation and showed equivalences between Moore and von Neumann neighborhoods, reducing the first to the second [@smith1971simple].

A key moment came with the invention of 2-D CA Game of Life. Pure mathematician J.H. Conway created "Life" as a solitaire and simulation type game. To play "Life" a checkerboard was needed, then counters or chips were put on top of some squares. This represented an initial alive population of organisms and the initial configuration would evolve following reproduction and dying rules. The rules were tweaked by Conway to produce unpredictable and mesmerizing patterns. The game was made popular when was published as recreational mathematics by Martin Gardner in 1970 [@gardner1970mathematical]. Despite its name and interesting properties "Life" has little biological meaning and should be only interpreted as a metaphor [@ermentrout1993cellular].

During the 80s the notoriety of CA was boosted to the current status as CA became quintessential examples of complex systems. The focus of research was shifted towards CA as modeling tools. Is in this decade that the first CA conference was held at MIT [@ilachinski2001cellular] and that a seminal review article of Stephen Wolfram was published [@wolfram1983statistical].

Since then applications have been coming in a variety of domains. In the biological sciences models of excitable media, developmental biology, ecology, shell pattern formation and immunology, to name a few, have been proposed [@ermentrout1993cellular]. CA can be applied in image processing for noise removal and border detection [@popovici2002cellular]. For physical systems fluid and gas dynamics are well suited for CA modeling [@margolus1984physics]. Also they have been proposed as a discrete approach to expressing physical laws [@vichniac1984simulating].

## Forest Fire Models

Forest fire models are a type of Probabilistic Cellular Automata (PCA). They try to capture the dynamics and general patterns of tree clusters that emerge from an evolving forest subject to perturbations.

They trace their origins to statistical physics and are closely related with percolation phenomena and dissipative structures. However they have been proved a valuable tool for ecological and natural hazard sciences as simple but powerful modeling tools [@zinck2010wildfire].

Forest fire models help to tackle questions like: Will the tree population eventually dies out?, What is the general shape of tree clusters?, What is the shape of the boundary between the forest and the fire?

At first glance forest fire models seem similar to epidemiological cellular automata models though they place emphasis on finite population and the persistence of a pathology over time in contrast to the infinite forest population and the emphasis on the spatial extension of the fire.

They broadly have the following characteristics [@louis2018probabilistic]:

1. Cells of at least three types:
  * Non-burning tree
  * Burning tree
  * No tree (empty)
2. A rule for fire initiation:
  * A starting configuration with fire cells, usually randomly chosen fire positions.
  * Accident simulation, like with a small probability self-ignition of a tree cell.
  * Space-time distributed ignition instances (e.g. Poisson distributed).
3. A rule for fire propagation. It involves a stochastic rule for fire spreading between neighborhoods that can be based on actual terrain conditions.

## The Drossel and Schwabl forest fire model

The forest fire model that will be used through this document is the Drossel and Schwabl model (DSM) [@drossel1992self].

DSM was born from research on statistical physics about phase transitions and self-organized criticality [@bak1990forest][@drossel1992self]. For this reason the CA was not intended as a modeling tool for real wildfires and was only a metaphor.

Nevertheless data from real wildfires was compared against DSM predictions with the, no so surprising, observation that the model did not perfectly match real world datasets, as it was build with the only concern of generating fire sizes following a power law. DSM was overestimating the frequency of large fires [@millington2006models]. Even though its origins and pitfalls DMS is still valuable, as it has a strong advantage against other wildfire models due to its simplicity and analytical tractability [@zinck2010wildfire]. Likewise it provides a set of starting assumptions that can be augmented to the required complexity along with the usually seen trade-off between increasing a model's predictive capabilities and its generalizing power.

Consequently success have been achieved using this simple model, for example fire shape patterns have been obtained that closely resemble actual wildfires [@zinck2008more][@zinck2010wildfire].

The Drossel and Schwabl model consist of a lattice in $\mathds{Z}^2$ populated with three type of cells: $0$ (no tree), $1$ (burning tree), and $2$ (non-burning tree). All cells are synchronously updated according to the following rules:
For each state $\sigma_k(n)$ at site $k$ and time step $n$.

* A burning tree is consumed at next time step:
$$\sigma_k(n) = 1 \mapsto  \sigma_k(n) = 0 \textrm{\quad With probability}\ 1$$

* A new tree grows from an empty position $k$, dictated by parameter $p \in [0,1]:$
$$\sigma_k(n) = 0 \mapsto  \sigma_k(n) = 2 \textrm{\quad With probability}\ p$$

* The fire is propagated through the vicinity or a lightning event occurs, which ignites a tree and is tuned by $f \in [0,1]:$
$$\sigma_k(n) = 2 \mapsto  \sigma_k(n) = 1$$
$$\textrm{With probability} \begin{cases}
  1, & \textrm{if at least one neighboring tree is burning}\\
  f, & \textrm{if no neighboring tree is burning}
  \end{cases}$$
