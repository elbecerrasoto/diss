# Introduction

## Motivations

Since antiquity the idea of building a thinking machine has always been in the minds of philosophers, artists, sciencemen, kings and commoners alike, filling us with wonder, terror and contemplation.  A human creation capable of human feats, would turn us, at least in an allegorical sense, into gods.

## Objectives

### Main Objectives

+ To propose a novel environment for Reinforcement Learning algorithms, based on Cellular Automata, that could be used as an alternative benchmark instead of Atari games.
+ Characterize the proposed environment by solving it by state of the art methods.

### Specific Objectives

+ Select the a Cellular Automaton model for the environment and program it, in this case the forest fire cellular automaton.
+ Propose a RL task to be realized on top of the CA.
+ Program the RL environment, following the Open AI gym API.
+ Apply Dual? Q-networks with its variants.
