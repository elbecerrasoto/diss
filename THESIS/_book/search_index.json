["introduction.html", "2 Introduction 2.1 Motivations 2.2 Objectives", " 2 Introduction 2.1 Motivations Since antiquity the idea of building a thinking machine has always been in the minds of philosophers, artists, sciencemen, kings and commoners alike, filling us with wonder, terror and contemplation. A human creation capable of human feats, would turn us, at least in an allegorical sense, into gods. 2.2 Objectives 2.2.1 Main Objectives To propose a novel environment for Reinforcement Learning algorithms, based on Cellular Automata, that could be used as an alternative benchmark instead of Atari games. Characterize the proposed environment by solving it by state of the art methods. 2.2.2 Specific Objectives Select the a Cellular Automaton model for the environment and program it, in this case the forest fire cellular automaton. Propose a RL task to be realized on top of the CA. Program the RL environment, following the Open AI gym API. Apply Dual? Q-networks with its variants. "],
["cellular-automata.html", "3 Cellular Automata 3.1 History 3.2 Motivation 3.3 Complex Systems", " 3 Cellular Automata Cellular Automata are mathematical systems that are mainly characterized by (Ilachinski 2001): A discrete lattice of cells: A n-dimesional arragement of cells, usually 1-D, 2-D or 3-D. Homogenity: Cells are equivalent in the sense that they share an update function and a set of possible states. Discrete states: Each cell is in one state from a finite set of possible states. Local Interactions: Cell interactions are local, this is given by the update function being dependant on neighbouring cells. Discrete Dynamics: The system evolves in discrete time steps. At each step the update function is applied to simultaneously (synchronously) to all cells. CA have been used as protoypical models of 3.1 History Jonh von Neumann following a suggestion from mathematician Stanislaw Ulam introduced Cellular Automata (CA) on 1948 to study self replicating systems, particularly biological organisms (Von Neumann and others 1951) (Von Neumann, Burks, and others 1966). The basic idea was to build a lattice in \\(\\mathds{Z}^2\\) capable of copying itself, to another location in \\(\\mathds{Z}^2\\). The solution, in spite of being elaborate and involving 29 different cell states, was modular and intuitive. Since then more constructions capable of the same feat have been found with a lesser number of states (Codd 1968). Some earlier precusor ideas can be traced back to 1946 cibernetics models by Wiener and Rosenbluth (Weiner and Rosenblunth 1946). A key moment came with the invention of 2-D CA Game of Life. Pure mathematician J.H. Conway created “Life” as a solitaire or simulation type game. To play “Life” a checkboard was needed, then counters or chips were put on top of some cells. This represented an initial alive population of organisms and the initial configuration would evolve following reproduction and dying rules. The rules were tweaked by Conway to produce unpredictable and mesmerazing patterns. The game was made popular when was published as recreational mathematics by Martin Gardner in 1970 (Gardner 1970). Despite its name and interesting properties “Life” has little biological meaning (Ermentrout and Edelstein-Keshet 1993). During the 80s the notoriety of CA was boosted to the current status and CA studies became quintessential examples of complex systems and useful modeling tools. Is in this decade that the first CA conference was held (Ilachinski 2001) and that the seminal review article of Stephen Wolfram was published (Wolfram 1983). Since then applications have been coming. In a review article of 1993 Key events in the history of Cellular Automata and Complex Systems.
